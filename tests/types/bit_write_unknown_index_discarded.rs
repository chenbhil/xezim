//! §11.5.1 — a bit-select WRITE at an unknown or out-of-range index modifies
//! no bits. The write-side sibling of `array_read_unknown_index_is_x`, and it
//! had the same cause: `to_u64().unwrap_or(0)`.
//!
//! `Value::to_u64` returns `Some(val_bits & !xz_bits)` — it masks x bits to
//! ZERO and never returns `None` — so every dynamic bit-store treated an
//! unknown index as bit 0 and wrote there. Out-of-range indices were already
//! handled, because `Value::set_bit` drops them, which is why a constant
//! out-of-range index behaved correctly all along and hid the shape of the
//! bug.
//!
//! An `initial` block and a task got this right, so the defect only showed
//! from inside an always block. That is the shape a wormhole arbiter uses to
//! build its per-input ready:
//!
//! ```systemverilog
//! always_comb begin
//!   ready_o = '0;
//!   ready_o[selected_idx] = (|valid_i) ? ready_i : '0;
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! At reset `valid_i` is x, so `selected_idx` is x and bit 0 of `ready_o`
//! picked up an x that the LRM says must never be written. Downstream that x
//! reached a crossbar's ready and stalled the router forever.
//!
//! Note that Verilator cannot referee this: it is 2-state here, resolves the
//! index to 0 and performs the write. The expected values below are the LRM's.
